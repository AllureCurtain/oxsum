//! A PostgreSQL-backed [`LedgerStore`].
//!
//! The schema is [`schema/postgres.sql`](https://github.com/hupe1980/doubleentry/blob/main/schema/postgres.sql),
//! applied by [`PostgresStore::migrate`]. Every constraint in it is load-bearing;
//! the two that are easy to get wrong are worth restating here.
//!
//! # Index assignment
//!
//! Log indices must be dense, gap-free, and in commit order. A `SEQUENCE` cannot
//! provide that: `nextval` is consumed before commit, so a transaction holding
//! index 5 may commit *after* one holding 6, and a reader tracking a high-water
//! mark steps over 5 permanently. The index is therefore assigned inside the
//! append, under a per-ledger advisory lock held for the transaction's duration.
//!
//! That serialises appends. It is the right trade for a first backend — correct
//! and simple — and the shape to move to under load is described in the schema's
//! operational notes.
//!
//! # How the tree is stored
//!
//! In `log_nodes`, apart from the entries: every Merkle node whose subtree is
//! complete, keyed by its position in the order nodes become complete. A
//! completed subtree can never change in an append-only log, so the table is
//! INSERT-only with a monotonic key, exactly like `entries`.
//!
//! Two things follow. A proof reads at most `1 + ceil(log2 n)` rows rather than
//! replaying the whole log, and archiving a prefix of `entries` to a
//! [cold tier](crate::storage::iceberg) leaves the tree — and therefore every
//! proof — intact.
//!
//! There is no stored root beside it. A head at any size is the same `O(log n)`
//! lookup, so a root column would be a second copy of a derived value, and two
//! fields that must agree are two fields that can disagree.
//!
//! # Integrity on read
//!
//! Rows are rehydrated through [`Entry::adopt_verified`], which recomputes the
//! content hash and compares it with the one stored alongside. A row altered
//! underneath the engine surfaces as an error on the next read rather than as a
//! wrong number in a report.
